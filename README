Asterisk is a free and open source framework for building communications
applications and is sponsored by Digium.

If you require support for Digium et al. hardware telephony boards, install
the required DAHDI software before compiling Asterisk. `dahdi-complete` is 
available as a SlackBuild.

Asterisk provides sample configuration files, which are built by default. They
will be installed as .new files if existing configuration files are present. To
suppress building of sample configurations, set SAMPLE_CONF to any non-empty
value:

SAMPLE_CONF=no ./asterisk-13.SlackBuild
